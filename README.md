## Number Guessing Game
This is a Number guessing game,
- The user selects a range, let’s say from 1 to 50.
- Then the compiler randomly selects  an integer in the range.
- The minimum number of guesses depends upon range. And the compiler must calculate the minimum number of guessing depends upon the range, on its own. For this, we have a formula:-
<p align=center> Minimum number of guessing = log2(Upper bound – lower bound + 1) </p>
